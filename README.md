# IndieExpo

[Live link][Live]

## Overview

A single-page web application inspired by Indiegogo. Users can create accounts, log in,
launch a fundraising campaign, search for campaigns, view and contribute to campaigns, and buy perks. 

## Technologies

IndieExpo was built using the following technologies:

- [ ] HTML5 (so you can see things)
- [ ] CSS3 (so the things you see will have pretty colors)
- [ ] JavaScript (so you can interact with the colorful and definitely visible things)
- [ ] jQuery (so the server will hear of your interactions)
- [ ] Ruby On Rails (so that your interactions might have consequences)
- [ ] React (so that those consequences might affect the things you see without having to reload all the things)
- [ ] Redux (so that a single, immutable record of your interactions might be kept and elegantly shared amongst the other things)
- [ ] PostgreSQL (so that the record of interactions might survive the cataclysmic event of a server restart)
- [ ] Go + Gorilla mux (for sending emails, repo [here][emailserver])
- [ ] Heroku (hosting)
- [ ] Cloudinary (CDN)
